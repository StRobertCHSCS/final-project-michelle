# The Labyrinth 
###### (working game name)

#### Objective of The Game

The point of my game is to make a maze where the player must go
around a maze and collect pieces of their "body" (arms, legs, head, etc). There are 3
different levels to the game with increasing difficulty.

**Level 1**: The maze is less winding, *the pieces are simply whole arms, whole legs*.

**Level 2**: The maze is bigger, more pathways, more dead ends, and the pieces are smaller
(*arms and legs are cut into halves; the head is split into 4 quarters*). 

**Level 3**:
- the maze becomes random, the walls moving and creating new dead ends
- maybe I should include that they can't touch the walls for too long in this level;
lest they lose health (level 3 and onward)
- timer countdown (level 3 and onward)

**Level 4**:
- Enemies spawn and will see & chase you if you enter their line of sight. Letting them
attack you

#### Gameplay Instructions/Mechanics
The player travels around as a red dot (more parts will be added as the player collects them) using the 4 arrow keys
(or maybe WASD, I haven't quite decided). As per usual, the player
cannot cross through the maze's walls. In Level 3 or 4, a health bar (3 heart containers)
will be introduced at the top left of the screen. To add even more difficulty, a timer will
become present on Level 3 and onward; everytime the player collects a piece, 10 (or 20) seconds
will be re-added to the timer, giving the player more time to collect the other pieces.
