# Bouncing Ball Game
###### (working game name)

### Game Objective
Keep the ball from falling off the screen by deflecting it with a rectangular bar.

### Gameplay Mechanics/Instructions
The player uses the arrow keys (or WASD, I haven't decided) to move a rectangular bar
left and right across the screen (the y-position is fixed). They must intercept the ball with the bar before the
ball falls off screen. Once it does, the game will restart. Successfully deflecting the ball for 60 secs
will allow the player to pass to the 2nd level. 

**Level 1**:  The player deflects one ball in this level. An added challenge is that every 15 secs, the ball's speed
will increase, making it harder and harder for the player.

**Level 2**: Now the player has to deal with two balls simultaneously, with the 15 sec rule applying to this level as well.

### Scoring
Every time the player successfully bounces the ball off the platform, they will be awarded one point. 

### To-do List
* Build the platform/bar and the ball
* Program their respective movements
* Program the countdown timer
* Program the speed increases
* Program the points counter
* Program the second ball
* Add sound
* Add a background (optional)
